# Description for bitcoinleveldb-versionedit crate

## Short Description

The `bitcoinleveldb-versionedit` crate provides
a Rust implementation of the version edit
structure for LevelDB, a high-performance
key-value storage library. It is part of the
subcomponents of the Bitcoin system.

## In-depth Description

The `bitcoinleveldb-versionedit` crate is a direct
translation from C++ to Rust of the version edit
structure in the Bitcoin system's LevelDB
implementation.

The VersionEdit structure is used to encode edits
made to the Version structure, which represents
a snapshot of the database at a specific point in
time. The edits can be used to update the version
information stored in the manifest file. The
manifest file contains a series of versions and
a pointer to the current version, which can be
used to recover the state of the database.

The `VersionEdit` structure contains methods to
encode and decode edits that can add, delete or
modify files in the database. It also has methods
to set the log file number, the last sequence
number, and the compact pointer for a given
level. The `VersionEditDeletedFileSet` structure
stores the deleted files.

## Notice

This crate is part of a direct translation from
C++ to Rust of the bitcoin core. As such, some of
the function bodies may still be in the process of
translation. Please note that this system will
become testable once the translation process is
complete.

91> could you teach me more about this interface?

Sure! The `VersionEdit` interface in LevelDB is
used to modify the `VersionSet`, which represents
the set of all versions of the key-value database
stored on disk.

Here's a breakdown of the methods in the
`VersionEdit` interface:

- `default() -> VersionEdit`: Creates a new
  `VersionEdit` object with default values.

- `set_comparator_name(name: &str)`: Sets the name
  of the comparator used to order keys in the
  database.

- `set_log_number(num: u64)`: Sets the number of
  the current log file.

- `set_prev_log_number(num: u64)`: Sets the number
  of the previous log file.

- `set_next_file(num: u64)`: Sets the number of
  the next file to be created.

- `set_last_sequence(seq: u64)`: Sets the last
  sequence number.

- `add_file(level: u64, file_num: u64, file_size:
  u64, smallest: InternalKey, largest:
  InternalKey, deleted: bool)`: Adds a new file to
  the specified level of the database. The
  `smallest` and `largest` parameters specify the
  range of keys in the file, and `deleted`
  indicates whether the file has been deleted or
  not.

- `delete_file(level: u64, file_num: u64)`: Marks
  the specified file as deleted.

- `encode_to<W: Write>(&self, writer: &mut W) ->
  Result<(), Error>`: Encodes the contents of the
  `VersionEdit` object and writes them to the
  given `Write` object.

- `decode_from<R: Read>(&mut self, reader: &mut R)
  -> Result<(), Error>`: Decodes the contents of
  a `VersionEdit` object from the given `Read`
  object and updates the current object
  accordingly.

- `debug_string(&self) -> String`: Returns
  a human-readable string representation of the
  `VersionEdit` object.

The `VersionEdit` interface is used to make
changes to the `VersionSet` and then persist those
changes to disk. It allows you to add new files to
the database, delete existing files, and update
various metadata such as the log file number and
the last sequence number.
