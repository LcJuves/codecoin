hello! 

I am writing a rust crate called bitcoin-hdkeypath. 

It is one of the subcomponets of the bitcoin
system.

I would like you to help me write a rust crate
description for it.

Please indicate that the crate is part of
a direct translation of the bitcoin codebase
from c++ to rust.

Make sure to indicate the possibility some of
the function bodies are still being translated.

Please write the description in the following
format:

<short description tag used in the crate header>
<double newline>
<longer, in depth description and mathematical analysis>
<END>

Below are listed some tokens from this crate. 

In case there are any mathematical ideas
identified by this information, please
describe them alongside the relevant
mathematical equations in unicode.

thanks!

please format your response in the Markdown
file format.

here are the tokens:
format_hd_keypath
parse_hd_keypath
write_hd_keypath
