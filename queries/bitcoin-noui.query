hello! 

I am writing a rust crate called bitcoin-noui. 

It is one of the subcomponets of the bitcoin
system.

I would like you to help me write a rust crate
description for it.

Please write the description in the following
format:

<short description tag used in the crate header>
<double newline>
<longer, in depth description and possible mathematical analysis>
<END>

I would like you to include the following
`Notice` in some part of your response:

"This crate is part of a direct translation
from C++ to Rust of the bitcoin core. As such,
some of the function bodies may still be in
the process of translation. Please note that
this system will become testable once the
translation process is complete"

Below are listed the tokens from this crate. 

Please describe any mathematical ideas
associated with these tokens alongside the
relevant mathematical equations in unicode.

If there are no mathematical ideas associated
with these tokens, say nothing.

Do not say: "there are no mathematical ideas
associated with these tokens".

thanks!

please format your response in the Markdown
file format.

here are the tokens:
noui_init_message
noui_init_message_redirect
noui_reconnect
noui_test_redirect
noui_thread_safe_message_box
noui_thread_safe_message_box_redirect
noui_thread_safe_question
noui_thread_safe_question_redirect
