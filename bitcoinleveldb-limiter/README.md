## bitcoinleveldb-limiter

The `bitcoinleveldb-limiter` crate provides
a simple rate limiter implementation for use in
the Bitcoin system.

The `Limiter` type implements a simple token
bucket algorithm, where tokens are added to the
bucket at a constant rate and can be consumed by
calling `acquire()`. If there are not enough
tokens in the bucket, the `acquire()` method will
block until there are enough tokens. Tokens can
also be manually released to the bucket by calling
`release()`.

This crate does not contain any mathematical ideas
or equations.

Notice: This crate is part of a direct translation
from C++ to Rust of the Bitcoin Core. As such,
some of the function bodies may still be in the
process of translation. Please note that this
system will become testable once the translation
process is complete.

36> how do we use the rate limiter in leveldb?

The rate limiter in LevelDB is used to limit the
rate of file system operations. This can be useful
in scenarios where disk I/O needs to be controlled
to prevent resource contention or to regulate
performance.

The rate limiter can be enabled by passing
a pointer to a Limiter object to the Options
object used to open a database. The Limiter object
can be created using the `Limiter::new()` method,
which takes two arguments: the rate at which bytes
should be read or written (in bytes per second)
and the size of the burst in bytes.

Once the Limiter object is created, it can be used
to regulate the rate of file system operations
using the `acquire()` and `release()` methods. The
`acquire()` method should be called before each
file system operation to ensure that the rate
limit is not exceeded. The `release()` method
should be called after each file system operation
to release any acquired resources.

Here is an example of how the rate limiter can be
used in Rust:

```rust
use bitcoinleveldb_limiter::{Limiter, acquire, release};
use bitcoinleveldb::{Options, DB};

let mut opts = Options::new();
let limiter = Limiter::new(1024 * 1024, 1024 * 1024 * 10); // 1 MB/s, burst of 10 MB
opts.set_rate_limiter(limiter);

let db = DB::open(opts, "mydb").unwrap();

let key = "hello".as_bytes();
let value = "world".as_bytes();

acquire(limiter, value.len() as u64);
db.put(key, value);
release(limiter, value.len() as u64);
```

In this example, the rate limiter is created with
a rate of 1 MB/s and a burst of 10 MB. Before
calling `db.put()`, the `acquire()` method is
called to acquire the necessary resources to write
the value to the database. After the write is
complete, the `release()` method is called to
release the acquired resources.

Note that the rate limiter is only applied to file
system operations performed by LevelDB, such as
reading and writing data to disk. It does not
regulate CPU usage or other system resources.
