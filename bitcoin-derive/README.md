# bitcoin-derive

## Description

`bitcoin-derive` is a proc macro crate in the
Bitcoin Rust workspace, providing macros for
deriving various traits for Bitcoin-related
types. This crate is a direct translation of the
Bitcoin codebase from C++ to Rust and some
function bodies may still be in the process of
translation.

## Features

`bitcoin-derive` provides macros for deriving
traits for Bitcoin-related types, including
serialization and deserialization traits, as well
as other custom traits used within the Bitcoin
ecosystem.

## Usage

To use `bitcoin-derive`, simply include it as
a dependency in your Rust project's `Cargo.toml`
file and then use the appropriate proc macros to
derive the desired traits for your Bitcoin-related
types.
