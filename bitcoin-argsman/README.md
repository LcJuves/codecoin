# bitcoin-argsman

A Rust crate for managing command-line arguments
and configurations for the Bitcoin system. This
crate is in the process of being translated from
C++ to Rust, and some of the function bodies are
still in the process of translation.

This crate provides a set of tools for parsing and
interpreting command-line arguments and
configuration files, as well as managing and
validating settings for the Bitcoin system. The
crate contains a number of types and functions
that allow for easy management of various
configuration options and parameters.

Some of the key features of this crate include:

- `ArgsManager`: A struct for managing
  command-line arguments and configuration files.

- `ArgDescriptor`: A struct for describing
  a single argument or option.

- `OptionsCategory`: A struct for grouping related
  command-line arguments.

- `BaseChainParams`: A struct for managing
  settings related to the Bitcoin blockchain.

- `SectionInfo`: A struct for managing information
  about a configuration file section.

- `ArgsManagerFlags`: A set of bitflags for
  controlling various aspects of `ArgsManager`.

- `ArgsManagerCommand`: A struct for defining
  a subcommand of the `bitcoin-argsman`
  command-line tool.

Some of the mathematical ideas behind this crate
include the use of bitflags for efficient storage
and manipulation of Boolean flags, as well as the
use of structs and functions for managing and
manipulating various types of data.

The following are some of the key functions and
methods provided by this crate:

- `get_data_dir()`: Returns the path to the
  Bitcoin data directory.

- `get_data_dir_base()`: Returns the base path of
  the data directory.

- `get_data_dir_net()`: Returns the path to the
  data directory for a specific Bitcoin network.

- `get_default_data_dir()`: Returns the default
  path to the Bitcoin data directory.

- `get_home_dir()`: Returns the path to the user's
  home directory.

- `strip_redundant_last_elements_of_path()`:
  Removes redundant elements from the end of
  a path.

- `parse_parameters()`: Parses command-line
  arguments into a set of `ArgDescriptor` objects.

- `read_config_files()`: Reads configuration files
  into memory and returns them as a vector of
  `SectionInfo` objects.

- `read_config_stream()`: Reads a single
  configuration file stream into memory and
  returns it as a `SectionInfo` object.

- `select_config_network()`: Selects the
  appropriate configuration network based on the
  command-line arguments.

- `write_settings_file()`: Writes the current
  settings to a configuration file.

Overall, `bitcoin-argsman` provides a powerful and
flexible set of tools for managing and
interpreting command-line arguments and
configuration files for the Bitcoin system.
