Greetings!

This workspace is in the process of being translated from C++ to Rust. 

Some function bodies are still in the process of translation. 
As such, the codebase is not yet ready for production use.  

Currently, it is ready for experimentation and development collaboration.

After each function body is translated, the codebase will match commit
ab25ef8c7f767258d5fe44f53b35ad8bd51ed5cd from the C++ upstream.  

Once there is a match of ab25ef8c, the next step is to patch until there is a match of the C++ HEAD.

There is a way to distribute the C++ commit patches into the rust workspace crates such that there is a simple patch chain for each crate.
This is much less complicated than the application of the whole patch chain globally.

The goal is to fully match the C++ core in a modular, high performance rust workspace. 

If this goal resonates with you, the writer is grateful for support accelerating the translation and testing. 

One purpose of the writer in this message is to indicate the translation task is now fully parallelized.  
Even before the c++ to rust transpiler is finished (see below), we can whack machete this codebase in parallel.

If this starts to happen, I will pause whatever else I am working on to resume cranking this project alongside you, whoever comes along with the machetes.

Here are some things which are helpful:
- pull requests completing (and testing) the translation of one or more of these crates.
- requests to distribute one or more crates in this workspace.  
The current author will happily provide crates.io ownership of any workspace crate whose translation arrives as a pull request from another developer in the community.

The writer has prototyped a C++ to Rust transpiler which can translate C++ statements into Rust. 
Once this transpiler is productionized, it will become possible for it to perform most of the heavy lifting involved in translating this codebase automatically.

The transpiler needs a performance upgrade in order to become practical for this purpose.
The writer has auxiliary tasks to complete.  In a few months, he will be back to help.

If there are developers out there who are interested in collaborating in the meantime, support will be provided.

best,
