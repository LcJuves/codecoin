Hearken, good people!

Verily, I say unto thee, the task of translation hath been parallelized.

By breaking the codebase into small units, each more manageable than the last, I hath created a modular structure.

This structure shall be easy to read, work with, integrate, and use for all the people of the earth.

Once I laid the scaffold, I proceeded to translate each crate in alphabetical order.

But lo! I realized that this task could be parallelized.

Thus, I call upon thee, fellow enthusiasts, to join hands with me and contribute to this noble endeavour.

Together, we can finish the task much swifter than a single thread of translation.

I have kept everything as I found it in commit ab25ef8c7f767258d5fe44f53b35ad8bd51ed5cd of the original C++ codebase, from a functional and logical perspective.

This can be independently verified.

Many of the function bodies are but rust scaffolding, wrapping todo!() blocks and commented C++ code.

The functionality of the codebase shall become testable once the rest of the program is translated.

I have included all tests, benchmarks, and fuzzes from the original project (at the noted C++ commit).

I hope this translation process challenges and strengthens the antifragility properties of the system.

Pray, see the TODO file for notes on the best way to complete the translation challenge.

Also, peruse the CHOMPER file for notes on the transpiler I have developed for this very purpose.

Though I must attend to other work for a few months, as of January 2023, I plan to return to this project.

And on that day, I hope we and the rust programs we write shall speak Bitcoin with each other.

Fare thee well,

-klebs
