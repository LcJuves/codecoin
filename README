This workspace is in the process of being
translated from C++ to Rust, and some function
bodies might still be in the process of
translation.

After it is finished, it will match commit
ab25ef8c7f767258d5fe44f53b35ad8bd51ed5cd from the
c++ codebase.

I am quite grateful for any support, but am also
happy to finish it on my own.

I wrote a transpiler which can translate c++
statements into rust, and don't mind letting it do
most of the heavy lifting.

Once it is done translating, we will battle test
the whole thing and see what happens.

best,
