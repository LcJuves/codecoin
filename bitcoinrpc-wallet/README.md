## bitcoinrpc-wallet

This Rust crate is a direct translation of the
wallet component of the Bitcoin Core from C++. It
provides a collection of RPC functions for
interacting with the Bitcoin wallet. These
functions can be used to create, backup, encrypt,
and unlock wallets, as well as perform operations
such as sending and receiving Bitcoin
transactions, listing transactions, managing
addresses and labels, and managing the keypool.

Note that some function bodies may still be in the
process of translation, and this system will
become testable once the translation process is
complete.

There are no mathematical ideas associated with
the tokens in this crate.

123> could you teach me about these RPC endpoints?

Sure, here's a brief overview of some of the RPC
endpoints in the bitcoinrpc-wallet crate:

- `abandontransaction`: This endpoint abandons
  a transaction that has not yet been confirmed in
  the blockchain. The command removes the
  transaction from the wallet and broadcasts
  a transaction to the network to ensure that
  other nodes remove it from their mempools.

- `backupwallet`: This endpoint creates a backup
  copy of the wallet.dat file containing all
  private keys and transaction information. It's
  important to regularly back up your wallet to
  prevent data loss in case of hardware failure or
  other issues.

- `createwallet`: This endpoint creates a new
  wallet file with the specified name. It is
  useful for separating funds for different
  purposes or for different users.

- `dumpprivkey`: This endpoint reveals the private
  key corresponding to the specified address. It's
  important to keep your private keys secure, as
  anyone with access to them can spend the
  associated funds.

- `encryptwallet`: This endpoint encrypts the
  wallet.dat file with a passphrase to protect
  against unauthorized access. The passphrase must
  be entered every time the wallet is unlocked to
  perform transactions.

- `getbalance`: This endpoint returns the total
  balance of the wallet, including both confirmed
  and unconfirmed transactions.

- `gettransaction`: This endpoint retrieves
  detailed information about a specific
  transaction, including inputs, outputs, fees,
  and confirmations.

- `listreceivedbyaddress`: This endpoint lists all
  addresses in the wallet that have received
  transactions, along with the total amount
  received by each address.

- `listunspent`: This endpoint lists all unspent
  transaction outputs (UTXOs) in the wallet that
  can be used as inputs for new transactions.

- `sendtoaddress`: This endpoint sends a specified
  amount of bitcoin to the specified address,
  deducting the amount from the available balance
  in the wallet.

- `walletlock`: This endpoint locks the wallet,
  requiring a passphrase to be entered before any
  further transactions can be performed.

These are just a few of the endpoints available in
the bitcoinrpc-wallet crate, but they give an idea
of the functionality provided by this component of
the Bitcoin system.
