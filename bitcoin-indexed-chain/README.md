# bitcoin-indexed-chain

The `bitcoin-indexed-chain` crate is part of
a direct translation of the Bitcoin codebase from
C++ to Rust. This crate is currently in the
process of translation and some function bodies
are still being translated.

The `bitcoin-indexed-chain` crate provides Rust
implementations for various Bitcoin
functionalities, including encoding and decoding
of keys, transaction handling, block chain
manipulation, and memory pool management. The
crate includes Rust structs such as `Output`,
`MerkleTx`, `Chain`, `ChainState`,
`MemPoolAccept`, and `NotificationsProxy` which
provide Rust implementations of Bitcoin data types
and functionalities.

This crate is an essential component of the
Bitcoin system and plays a crucial role in
facilitating Bitcoin transactions and block chain
management. While there are no specific
mathematical equations or concepts involved in
this crate, it relies heavily on the cryptographic
principles and mechanisms that underlie the
Bitcoin system.

Please note that this crate is still in the
process of translation and some function bodies
may not yet be fully implemented.

2> thanks -- could you please describe the most
important tokens found in this crate?

Certainly, here are some of the most important
tokens found in the `bitcoin-indexed-chain` crate:

- `Chain`: This Rust struct provides an interface
  for manipulating the Bitcoin block chain. It
  includes functions such as `set_tip`, `height`,
  and `next` which allow for block chain traversal
  and management.

- `Output`: This Rust struct represents a Bitcoin
  output, which is an amount of Bitcoin that is
  locked in a transaction and can be spent only by
  a specific recipient. The `Output` struct
  includes fields such as `value`,
  `script_pubkey`, and `tx_index`.

- `MerkleTx`: This Rust struct represents
  a Bitcoin transaction with a Merkle root. It
  includes fields such as `version`, `inputs`,
  `outputs`, and `witnesses`, which allow for
  manipulation and management of the transaction
  data.

- `MemPoolAccept`: This Rust trait defines the
  interface for accepting Bitcoin transactions
  into the memory pool. It includes functions such
  as `check_fee_rate` and `pre_checks` which are
  used to validate transactions before they are
  accepted into the pool.

- `NotificationsProxy`: This Rust struct provides
  an interface for notifying clients of Bitcoin
  events, such as new block arrivals or
  transaction confirmations. It includes functions
  such as `transaction_added_to_mempool` and
  `updated_block_tip` which allow for notification
  of these events.

- `ChainState`: This Rust struct represents the
  state of the Bitcoin block chain. It includes
  fields such as `chain_impl`, `tip`, and
  `coins_tip`, which provide information on the
  current state of the block chain.

These tokens are just a sample of the many
important components found in the
`bitcoin-indexed-chain` crate. Together, they
provide a robust set of tools for managing and
manipulating the Bitcoin block chain and
facilitating Bitcoin transactions.

3> so Chain is an interface for manipulating the
bitcoin blockchain? what can we do with this
interface?

Yes, that's correct! The `Chain` struct provides
an interface for manipulating the Bitcoin block
chain. Here are some of the main functions that
can be used with this interface:

- `set_tip`: This function is used to set the
  current tip of the block chain. The tip is the
  most recently added block in the chain.

- `height`: This function returns the height of
  the current tip of the block chain.

- `next`: This function is used to traverse the
  block chain, starting from a given block, and
  returning the next block in the chain.

- `next_sync_block`: This function is similar to
  `next`, but is used when syncing with the
  network. It takes a `locator` as an argument,
  which is a list of block hashes representing the
  chain from the client's perspective.

- `genesis`: This function returns the genesis
  block of the block chain.

- `make_chain`: This function is used to construct
  a new block chain from a list of blocks.

- `find_earliest_at_least`: This function is used
  to find the earliest block in the chain that is
  at least a given height.

- `find_fork`: This function is used to find the
  fork point between two chains.

These functions, along with others in the `Chain`
interface, allow for the traversal and
manipulation of the Bitcoin block chain. For
example, one could use these functions to iterate
through the blocks in the chain, validate
transactions, or construct a new block chain from
a set of existing blocks.

4> where is the blockchain stored?

In the Bitcoin system, the block chain is stored
as a collection of blocks on nodes that run the
Bitcoin software. Each block contains a list of
transactions, and each block is linked to the
previous block in the chain.

The nodes that store the block chain are known as
"full nodes". These nodes download and validate
every block in the chain, and keep a copy of the
entire block chain on their local storage. This
allows them to independently verify the state of
the Bitcoin network and participate in the network
by validating transactions and broadcasting new
blocks.

The storage location of the block chain varies
depending on the configuration of the node. By
default, the Bitcoin Core software stores the
block chain data in a folder called "blocks" in
the Bitcoin data directory. This directory can be
changed by modifying the Bitcoin configuration
file.

It's worth noting that the size of the block chain
increases over time as new blocks are added, so
the storage requirements for running a full node
can be significant. As of March 2023, the Bitcoin
block chain is approximately 405 GB in size.

5> so, does Chain need to access disk on the local
machine? or are parts of the blockchain kept in
memory?

The `Chain` struct in the `bitcoin-indexed-chain`
crate provides an interface for manipulating the
Bitcoin block chain, but it does not specify how
the block chain data is stored.

In the Bitcoin system, the block chain is
typically stored on disk in a folder called
"blocks". However, when a full node is running, it
will usually keep the most frequently accessed
parts of the block chain in memory in order to
speed up access times.

When the `Chain` struct is used to traverse the
block chain, it may need to access the disk to
retrieve blocks that are not currently in
memory. However, the exact details of how the
block chain data is accessed and stored will
depend on the specific implementation of the
Bitcoin software being used, as well as the
configuration of the local node.

It's worth noting that accessing the block chain
data on disk can be a time-consuming process,
especially for nodes that are not running on
high-performance hardware. This is why it's
important to keep frequently accessed parts of the
block chain in memory, in order to minimize disk
access times and improve the performance of the
node.

8> how do we ensure we are not double spending?

Double-spending is a problem that arises when the
same Bitcoin output is used in two different
transactions. This can occur when an attacker
attempts to spend the same Bitcoin twice, either
by submitting two conflicting transactions at the
same time or by attempting to modify an
already-confirmed transaction.

To prevent double-spending, the Bitcoin system
relies on a combination of cryptographic and
consensus mechanisms. Here are some of the key
techniques used to prevent double-spending:

- Cryptographic signatures: Each Bitcoin
  transaction includes a digital signature, which
  is created using the private key of the
  sender. This signature proves that the sender is
  authorized to spend the Bitcoin being
  transferred. When a transaction is broadcast to
  the network, other nodes can verify the
  signature to ensure that the transaction is
  legitimate and has not been tampered with.

- Transaction validation: Each Bitcoin full node
  validates each transaction it receives to ensure
  that it meets the Bitcoin protocol rules. For
  example, a transaction must have a valid digital
  signature, must not attempt to spend more
  Bitcoin than the sender has available, and must
  not conflict with any other transactions in the
  network.

- Block chain consensus: Bitcoin relies on
  a distributed network of nodes to maintain
  a consensus view of the block chain. When a new
  block is added to the chain, all nodes in the
  network validate the block and its transactions
  to ensure that they meet the protocol rules. If
  a block or transaction violates the rules, it
  will be rejected by the network and will not be
  accepted as part of the block chain.

- Confirmation time: Once a Bitcoin transaction is
  included in a block and added to the block
  chain, it becomes increasingly difficult to
  double-spend the output. This is because each
  subsequent block that is added to the chain
  builds upon the previous blocks, creating
  a growing "chain of trust" that makes it more
  and more difficult to modify earlier blocks.

Overall, preventing double-spending is a critical
aspect of the Bitcoin protocol, and the system
relies on a combination of cryptographic,
consensus, and confirmation techniques to ensure
that each Bitcoin output can be spent only once.
