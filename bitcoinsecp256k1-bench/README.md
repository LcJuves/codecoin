# bitcoinsecp256k1-bench crate description

This crate is part of the Bitcoin system and is
a Rust translation of the C++ Bitcoin Core. It
provides benchmarking tools for various secp256k1
functions.

Notice: "This crate is part of a direct
translation from C++ to Rust of the Bitcoin
Core. As such, some of the function bodies may
still be in the process of translation. Please
note that this system will become testable once
the translation process is complete."

125> how do we benchmark ecdh? what are some
techniques?

In general, benchmarking ecdh involves measuring
the time it takes to perform a large number of key
exchanges between two parties. The goal is to
evaluate the performance of the implementation of
the ecdh algorithm under different conditions,
such as different key sizes, different message
sizes, and different hardware configurations.

One common technique for benchmarking ecdh is to
use a fixed set of parameters, such as a fixed key
size and a fixed message size, and measure the
time it takes to perform a fixed number of key
exchanges. This allows for a comparison of
different implementations under the same
conditions.

Another technique is to vary the key size or the
message size and measure the time it takes to
perform a single key exchange. This allows for an
evaluation of the performance of the
implementation as the size of the inputs change.

In addition to measuring the time it takes to
perform key exchanges, other metrics can be used
to evaluate the performance of ecdh, such as
memory usage and code size.

It is important to carefully select the benchmarks
used to evaluate ecdh, as different benchmarks can
produce different results and may not accurately
reflect the performance of the implementation in
a real-world scenario.

126> are there other techniques?

Yes, there are other techniques for benchmarking
ECDH. One common technique is to use
a pre-computed table of points, known as
a precomputed table. This table can be used to
speed up the scalar multiplication operation by
a significant amount. Another technique is to use
a cache to store the intermediate values of the
scalar multiplication operation, which can also
improve performance. Additionally, optimizing the
implementation of the underlying elliptic curve
arithmetic can also lead to performance gains.
