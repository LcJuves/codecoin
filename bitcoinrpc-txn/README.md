# bitcoinrpc-txn

This Rust crate is a translation of the
`bitcoin-txn` component of the Bitcoin system. It
provides functions related to creating, analyzing,
decoding, and signing Bitcoin transactions.

Notice: This crate is part of a direct translation
from C++ to Rust of the bitcoin core. As such,
some of the function bodies may still be in the
process of translation. Please note that this
system will become testable once the translation
process is complete.

The following mathematical ideas are associated
with the tokens in this crate:

- `construct_transaction`: This function is used
  to construct a Bitcoin transaction, which is
  a set of inputs and outputs that transfer
  Bitcoin between addresses. The inputs to
  a transaction are unspent outputs from previous
  transactions, and the outputs specify the
  destination addresses and amounts to be
  transferred. The mathematical idea behind
  transactions is the concept of a digital
  signature scheme, which allows a user to prove
  that they are the owner of a particular Bitcoin
  address and authorize the transfer of funds from
  that address.

- `sign_transaction`: This function is used to
  sign a Bitcoin transaction with a private key
  associated with one of the inputs. The
  mathematical idea behind digital signatures is
  the use of elliptic curve cryptography to create
  a pair of keys, a private key and a public key,
  which are used to sign and verify transactions
  respectively. The signature is a mathematical
  proof that the owner of the private key
  authorized the transaction.

- `parse_prevouts`: This function parses the
  previous transaction outputs (prevouts) from
  a serialized Bitcoin transaction. The
  mathematical idea behind prevouts is the concept
  of a transaction input, which refers to an
  unspent output from a previous transaction. The
  prevout contains information about the
  transaction output being spent, including its
  amount and the scriptPubKey that controls the
  funds.

- `tx_tojson`: This function converts a Bitcoin
  transaction to a JSON format. The mathematical
  idea behind this function is the use of
  a standard data format to represent the
  transaction, which allows it to be easily
  transmitted and processed by different software
  systems.

Other functions in this crate, such as
`analyzepsbt`, `combinepsbt`, `getrawtransaction`,
and `verifytxoutproof`, are used for analyzing,
decoding, and verifying Bitcoin transactions, and
do not have direct mathematical ideas associated
with them.

118> which RPC endpoints are associated with this
subsystem?

The following RPC endpoints are associated with
the `bitcoinrpc-txn` subsystem:

- `analyzepsbt`
- `combinepsbt`
- `combinerawtransaction`
- `converttopsbt`
- `createpsbt`
- `createrawtransaction`
- `decodepsbt`
- `decoderawtransaction`
- `decodescript`
- `finalizepsbt`
- `getrawtransaction`
- `gettxoutproof`
- `joinpsbts`
- `sendrawtransaction`
- `signrawtransactionwithkey`
- `testmempoolaccept`
- `utxoupdatepsbt`
- `verifytxoutproof`

These endpoints allow the user to create, analyze,
and modify transactions in various ways, such as
constructing raw transactions, signing
transactions, and verifying transaction proofs.

119> what do these do? could you describe them in
more detail?

Sure! Here is a brief description of each of the
RPC endpoints associated with the `bitcoinrpc-txn`
subsystem:

- `analyzepsbt`: Analyzes and provides information
  about a partially signed Bitcoin transaction.

- `combinepsbt`: Combines multiple partially
  signed Bitcoin transactions into one.

- `combinerawtransaction`: Combines multiple raw
  transactions into one.

- `converttopsbt`: Converts a raw transaction to
  a partially signed Bitcoin transaction.

- `createpsbt`: Creates a partially signed Bitcoin
  transaction.

- `createrawtransaction`: Creates a raw Bitcoin
  transaction.

- `decodepsbt`: Decodes a partially signed Bitcoin
  transaction.

- `decoderawtransaction`: Decodes a raw Bitcoin
  transaction.

- `decodescript`: Decodes a Bitcoin script.

- `finalizepsbt`: Finalizes a partially signed
  Bitcoin transaction.

- `getrawtransaction`: Returns a raw Bitcoin
  transaction.

- `gettxoutproof`: Returns a proof that
  a transaction is included in a block.

- `joinpsbts`: Joins multiple partially signed
  Bitcoin transactions into one.

- `sendrawtransaction`: Submits a raw Bitcoin
  transaction to the network.

- `signrawtransactionwithkey`: Signs a raw Bitcoin
  transaction with a private key.

- `testmempoolaccept`: Tests acceptance of a raw
  transaction in the mempool.

- `utxoupdatepsbt`: Updates a partially signed
  Bitcoin transaction with UTXO information.

- `verifytxoutproof`: Verifies that a proof is
  a valid proof of a transaction being included in
  a block.

- `construct_transaction`: Constructs a Bitcoin
  transaction given a set of inputs and outputs.

- `parse_prevouts`: Parses the previous outputs
  referenced by a Bitcoin transaction.

- `sign_transaction`: Signs a Bitcoin transaction
  with a set of private keys.

- `sign_transaction_result_tojson`: Converts the
  result of a `sign_transaction` call to a JSON
  object.

- `tx_in_error_tojson`: Converts a transaction
  input error to a JSON object.

These RPC endpoints allow for a wide range of
operations related to constructing, analyzing,
decoding, and signing Bitcoin transactions.
