# bitcoin-leveldb

`bitcoin-leveldb` is a Rust crate that provides
a high-level interface to the LevelDB database
subsystem used in the Bitcoin system. It is
a direct translation of the corresponding C++
codebase and is currently in the process of
translation.

This crate is a wrapper for the subcrates in the
Bitcoin LevelDB subsystem, including
`bitcoinleveldb_arena`, `bitcoinleveldb_batch`,
`bitcoinleveldb_bench`, and many others. The crate
provides a simple and convenient way to access the
functionality of these subcrates from Rust.

**Note:** It is possible that some function bodies
are still being translated.

## Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
bitcoin-leveldb = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the
`bitcoin-leveldb` crate to access the
`bitcoinleveldb_db` functionality:

```rust
use bitcoin_leveldb::DB;

let db_path = "/path/to/your/database";
let db_options = DBOptions::new();
let cf_options = ColumnFamilyOptions::new();

let db = bitcoinleveldb_db::open(db_path, db_options, vec![cf_options], true).unwrap();

db.put(&WriteOptions::new(), b"key", b"value").unwrap();

let value = db.get(&ReadOptions::new(), b"key").unwrap().unwrap();
assert_eq!(value, b"value");
```

For more examples and details, please check the
documentation for the specific subcrate you are
using.

90> thanks -- could you teach me some more about
leveldb from a high level? we will get into the
specifics inside each subcomponent

Sure, I'd be happy to help!

LevelDB is a high-performance key-value storage
library developed by Google. It is designed to be
embedded in other applications and can handle
a large amount of data. The key-value pairs can be
arbitrary byte strings, which makes it useful for
storing serialized data.

One of the key features of LevelDB is its
efficient use of disk space. It is designed to
minimize the amount of disk space needed to store
data by using a technique called block
compression. LevelDB also supports snapshots,
which allow the state of the database to be
captured at a specific point in time.

Another important feature of LevelDB is its
support for transactions. LevelDB can perform
multiple operations as part of a single
transaction, and if any part of the transaction
fails, the entire transaction will be rolled
back. This helps ensure data consistency and
reliability.

LevelDB also includes features like caching and
bloom filters, which improve performance by
reducing the number of disk accesses required to
look up a key-value pair.

Overall, LevelDB is a powerful and flexible
storage library that can be used in a wide variety
of applications, including databases, caching
systems, and search engines.

91> how is leveldb used in the context of the
bitcoin system?

In the context of the Bitcoin system, LevelDB is
used to store and manage the blockchain data. The
blockchain is a continuously growing list of
records, called blocks, that are linked and
secured using cryptography. Each block contains
a record of several transactions, and these blocks
are added to the blockchain in a sequential
manner.

LevelDB provides a key-value database that is used
to store and retrieve the blockchain data
efficiently. In particular, the blocks are stored
as key-value pairs in LevelDB, where the block's
hash is used as the key and the block's serialized
data is used as the value.

The use of LevelDB in the Bitcoin system allows
for efficient and fast access to blockchain data,
which is critical for various tasks such as
validating transactions and calculating
balances. The Bitcoin system uses LevelDB as
a backend database for other components such as
the Bitcoin Core software and Bitcoin wallets.
