/*!
  | A Cache is an interface that maps keys to
  | values.  It has internal synchronization and
  | may be safely accessed concurrently from
  | multiple threads.  It may automatically evict
  | entries to make room for new entries.  Values
  | have a specified charge against the cache
  | capacity.  For example, a cache where the
  | values are variable length strings, may use the
  | length of the string as the charge for the
  | string.
  |
  | A builtin cache implementation with
  | a least-recently-used eviction policy is
  | provided.  Clients may use their own
  | implementations if they want something more
  | sophisticated (like scan-resistance, a custom
  | eviction policy, variable cache sizing, etc.)
