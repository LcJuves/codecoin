/**
  | This is the Branch and Bound Coin Selection
  | algorithm designed by Murch. It searches
  | for an input set that can pay for the spending
  | target and does not exceed the spending
  | target by more than the cost of creating
  | and spending a change output. The algorithm
  | uses a depth-first search on a binary
  | tree. In the binary tree, each node corresponds
  | to the inclusion or the omission of a
  | UTXO. UTXOs are sorted by their effective
  | values and the trees is explored deterministically
  | per the inclusion branch first. At each
  | node, the algorithm checks whether
  | the selection is within the target range.
  | 
  | While the selection has not reached
  | the target range, more UTXOs are included.
  | When a selection's value exceeds the
  | target range, the complete subtree
  | deriving from this selection can be
  | omitted.
  | 
  | At that point, the last included UTXO
  | is deselected and the corresponding
  | omission branch explored instead.
  | The search ends after the complete tree
  | has been searched or after a limited
  | number of tries.
  | 
  | The search continues to search for better
  | solutions after one solution has been
  | found. The best solution is chosen by
  | minimizing the waste metric. The waste
  | metric is defined as the cost to spend
  | the current inputs at the given fee rate
  | minus the long term expected cost to
  | spend the inputs, plus the amount the
  | selection exceeds the spending target:
  | 
  | waste = selectionTotal - target + inputs
  | Ã— (currentFeeRate - longTermFeeRate)
  | 
  | The algorithm uses two additional optimizations.
  | A lookahead keeps track of the total
  | value of the unexplored UTXOs. A subtree
  | is not explored if the lookahead indicates
  | that the target range cannot be reached.
  | Further, it is unnecessary to test equivalent
  | combinations. This allows us to skip
  | testing the inclusion of UTXOs that
  | match the effective value and waste
  | of an omitted predecessor.
  | 
  | The Branch and Bound algorithm is described
  | in detail in Murch's Master Thesis:

  | -----------
  | @param const
  | 
  | std::vector<CInputCoin>& utxo_pool
  | The set of UTXOs that we are choosing
  | from.
  | 
  | These UTXOs will be sorted in descending
  | order by effective value and the CInputCoins'
  | values are their effective values.
  | ----------
  | @param const
  | 
  | CAmount& selection_target This is
  | the value that we want to select. It is
  | the lower bound of the range.
  | ----------
  | @param const
  | 
  | CAmount& cost_of_change This is the
  | cost of creating and spending a change
  | output.
  | 
  | This plus selection_target is the upper
  | bound of the range.
  | ----------
  | @param std
  | 
  | ::set<CInputCoin>& out_set -> This
  | is an output parameter for the set of
  | CInputCoins that have been selected.
  | ----------
  | @param CAmount
  | 
  | & value_ret -> This is an output parameter
  | for the total value of the CInputCoins
  | that were selected.
