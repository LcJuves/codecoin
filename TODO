As far as I see it, the procedure to finish this
translation project is as follows:

--------------------------
1) translate each bitcoin-* crate in parallel.

(see note in the file `CHOMPER`)

It is likely the best way to translate each crate
is on a separate branch, merging back in to main
once the crate is fully filled in. 

It is in this respect that I consider the
translation to be parallelized: the working
branches for each crate translation may all exist
simultaneously.

--------------------------
2) merge all translated crate branches

It may be that certain functions/structures will
need to get moved around some (though probably not
very much)

It may be that certain inter-crate dependencies
will emerge as the `todo` blocks of commented c++
code are uncommented. This is natural and
expected.  

3) translate all tests and benchmarks

4) pass full test suite

5) translate into and apply the c++ patches since
   ab25ef8c7f767258d5fe44f53b35ad8bd51ed5cd

6) add tests as necessary
