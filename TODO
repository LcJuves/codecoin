As far as I see it, the procedure to finish this
translation project is as follows:

--------------------------
1) translate each bitcoin-* crate in parallel.

(see note in the file `CHOMPER`)

--------------------------
2) merge results of #1 if necessary

It may be that certain functions/structures will
need to get moved around some (though probably not
very much)

It may be that certain inter-crate dependencies
will emerge as the `todo` blocks of commented c++
code are uncommented. This is expected.  

3) translate tests + benchmarks

4) pass full test suite

5) translate into and apply the c++ patches since
   ab25ef8c7f767258d5fe44f53b35ad8bd51ed5cd

6) add tests as necessary
