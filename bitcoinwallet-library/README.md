# bitcoinwallet-library

This Rust crate is a direct translation from C++
to Rust of the Bitcoin Core wallet
implementation. It provides functions for creating
and managing Bitcoin wallets, including generating
new private keys, signing transactions, and
synchronizing with the Bitcoin network.

Notice: This crate is part of a direct translation
from C++ to Rust of the Bitcoin Core. As such,
some of the function bodies may still be in the
process of translation. Please note that this
system will become testable once the translation
process is complete.

The following mathematical concepts are associated
with some of the tokens used in this crate:

- Private key: A private key in Bitcoin is
  a randomly generated 256-bit integer. It is used
  to generate the public key, which in turn is
  used to create a Bitcoin address. The private
  key is also used to sign transactions. The
  security of the Bitcoin system relies on the
  fact that it is computationally infeasible to
  derive the private key from the public key or
  the Bitcoin address. The equation for generating
  a Bitcoin public key from a private key is:

  ```
  public_key = G * private_key
  ```

  where G is the generator point of the elliptic
  curve used in Bitcoin's digital signature
  algorithm.

- Public key: A public key in Bitcoin is a point
  on the elliptic curve generated by multiplying
  the generator point G by the private key. The
  public key is used to create a Bitcoin address
  and to verify the digital signature of
  a transaction. The equation for verifying
  a digital signature in Bitcoin is:

  ```
  sG = R + eP
  ```

  where s is the signature, R is the signature's
  first component, e is the message hash, G is the
  generator point, and P is the public key.

- Bitcoin address: A Bitcoin address is a 160-bit
  hash of the public key. It is used to receive
  Bitcoin payments. The equation for generating
  a Bitcoin address from a public key is:

  ```
  address = RIPEMD160(SHA256(public_key))
  ```

  where RIPEMD160 and SHA256 are hash functions
  used in Bitcoin.

- Transaction: A transaction in Bitcoin is
  a signed message that transfers Bitcoin from one
  address to another. The transaction includes the
  input(s), which are the Bitcoin(s) to be spent,
  and the output(s), which are the Bitcoin(s) to
  be received. The equation for signing a Bitcoin
  transaction is:

  ```
  s = k^(-1)(e + da) mod n
  ```

  where s is the signature, k is a random number,
  e is the message hash, d is the private key,
  a is the ephemeral public key, and n is the
  order of the elliptic curve.
