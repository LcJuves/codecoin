## `bitcoin-restapi` Crate Description

#### Short Description Tag: `Bitcoin REST API`

The `bitcoin-restapi` crate is a direct Rust
translation of the Bitcoin REST API from the
original C++ codebase. It is still a work in
progress and some function bodies are still being
translated.

#### In-Depth Description and Mathematical Analysis

The `bitcoin-restapi` crate provides a RESTful
interface for interacting with a Bitcoin node. It
includes a number of endpoints for retrieving
information about the blockchain, mempool, and
individual transactions.

The crate contains several functions for
interacting with the Bitcoin network, such as
`get_chainman` and `get_mem_pool`. These functions
allow a user to retrieve information about the
current state of the Bitcoin network, such as the
current blockchain height and the contents of the
mempool.

Additionally, the `bitcoin-restapi` crate includes
functions for retrieving information about
specific blocks and transactions. The `rest_block`
and `rest_tx` functions allow a user to retrieve
information about a specific block or transaction
by its hash.

There are also functions for retrieving extended
information about a block and its transactions,
such as `rest_block_extended` and
`rest_block_notxdetails`. These functions return
additional details about the block, such as its
size and the total transaction fees included in
the block.

In terms of mathematical analysis, there are no
specific mathematical equations or concepts
involved in the `bitcoin-restapi` crate. However,
some of the information returned by the API, such
as the total transaction fees included in a block,
may be of interest to those studying Bitcoin
economics.
