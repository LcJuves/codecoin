/**
  | Banman manages two related but distinct
  | concepts:
  |
  | 1. Banning. This is configured manually by the
  | user, through the setban RPC.  If an address or
  | subnet is banned, we never accept incoming
  | connections from it and never create outgoing
  | connections to it. We won't gossip its address
  | to other peers in addr messages. Banned
  | addresses and subnets are stored to disk on
  | shutdown and reloaded on startup. Banning can
  | be used to prevent connections with spy nodes
  | or other griefers.
  |
  | 2. Discouragement. If a peer misbehaves enough
  | (see Misbehaving() in net_processing.cpp),
  | we'll mark that address as discouraged. We
  | still allow incoming connections from them, but
  | they're preferred for eviction when we receive
  | new incoming connections. We never make
  | outgoing connections to them, and do not gossip
  | their address to other peers. This is
  | implemented as a bloom filter. We can
  | (probabilistically) test for membership, but
  | can't list all discouraged addresses or unmark
  | them as discouraged. Discouragement can prevent
  | our limited connection slots being used up by
  | incompatible or broken peers.
  |
  | Neither banning nor discouragement are
  | protections against denial-of-service attacks,
  | since if an attacker has a way to waste our
  | resources and we disconnect from them and ban
  | that address, it's trivial for them to
  | reconnect from another IP address.
  |
  | Attempting to automatically disconnect or ban
  | any class of peer carries the risk of splitting
  | the network. For example, if we
  | banned/disconnected for a transaction that
  | fails a policy check and a future version
  | changes the policy check so the transaction is
  | accepted, then that transaction could cause the
  | network to split between old nodes and new
  | nodes.
